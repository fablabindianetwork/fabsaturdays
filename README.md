# Fab Saturdays

In hopes of spreading the art of Digital Fabrication, Fablab Kerala is conducting an Introduction to Digital Fabrication workshop in two of its labs in Kerala. The workshop will be conducted on every Saturday at each of labs for a total duration of about 2 months (6 Saturdays). The workshop is designed to give an overview of all the rapid prototyping capabilities of Fablab Kerala. In this hands-on workshop, the participants will get to work on various prototyping methods like, 3D Printing, Laser Cutting, Screen printing, Designing and fabricating custom printed circuit boards,  CNC Milling using 3-Axis large format CNC milling machine, How to design a product etc.

 The series of workshops will begin from 28th Oct 2017. The workshop timing will be from 10am to 5pm. An overview of the syllabus is shown below.
