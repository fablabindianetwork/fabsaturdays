# Introduction to CNC Milling

CNC stands for Computer Numeric Control, it is a process used in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computers to control machine tools.  Here, instead of the operator controlling the machine, the machine follows a set of instructions to  move the gantry and  make the desired shape. A popular way of giving instructions to the machine is by using G-code. The various movements of the machine for creating a part are programmed  in code and fed into the controller, which moves the machine. Some common CNC machines include lathes, mills, routers and grinders.

The process involves creating a CAD (Computer Aided Design)  file of the desired object. Then a specialized CAM (computer aided Manufacturing) software is required to convert the 3D CAD file into a set of codes which the machines can understand. this     G -code  controls all machine parameters like feed rate, coordination, location and speeds. With CNC machining, the computer can control exact positioning and velocity.

ShopBot PRSalpha are the toughest, most sophisticated, gantry-based CNC routers. Using advanced technology for CNC cutting, drilling, carving and machining, the PRSalpha series tools deliver rapid transit speeds of 1800 inches per minute and cutting speeds of up to 600 inches per minute. Its easy to configure and use. The PRSalpha has a bed size of 8x4 feet and delivers full production performance in digital fabrication of wood, plastic, aluminum, and other materials. 

## Workflow of Milling with Shopbot

1. Design the 2D, 3D model in any CAD software like Solidworks, AutoCAD etc.
2. Export the  2D model in DXF and 3D model in STL format.
3. Import the design into Vcarve pro, set the machine parameters and export as SBP file.
4. Prep the material by securely attaching it to the bed using screws and clamps.
5. Securely attach the end mill to the spindle.
6. Set the Z-origin by using the contact plate. Set the X,Y origin to a suitable place on the material.
7. Load the SBP file into  Shopbot software interface.
8. Turn on the spindle and start cutting.

## Warning

- CNC milling is hazardous, never stand close to the machine while its operational.
- End mill spinning at such high velocity has possibility of ejecting wooden shards and hot debris.
- Always wear eye protection.
- Never reach into the machine while operating.
- Always secure the work piece and tool properly to avoid damage.
- Never leave the machine running unattended.
