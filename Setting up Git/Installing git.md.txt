#Git and Version Control
Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. It keeps track of every modification to the code in a database. Even if you're just a single developer, version control helps you stay organized as you fix bugs and develop new features. It keeps a history of your development so that you can review and even rollback to any version of your code with ease.

##Version control workflow

1.Get a local copy of code if they don't have one yet.
2.Make changes to code to fix bugs or add new features.
3.Once the code is ready, make it available for review by your team.
4.Once the code is reviewed, merge it into the team's shared codebase.
